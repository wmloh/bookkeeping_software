# bookkeeping_software
A basic bookkeeping software that automates entering transactions into financial statements.

Author's note:

This is my first original complete software (but have yet to go through extensive testing)! I embarked on this project a month and a half after learning my first programming language.
Hence, there will be many hardcoded sections as well as poorly designed algorithms since I had no formal knowledge of computer science at
that time. Fortunately, the functionality of the program is not affected by those. Through this project, I gained exposure to computer
graphics, Openpyxl library, user interface and some data management. Also, I learnt domain-specific knowledge which is, in this case, Financial Accounting.

This software provides a simplistic and accessible GUI for bookkeepers to produce Income Statement, Statement of Retained Earnings.
There are many possible ways to improve this software such as enabling quantitative functions (calculating simple amortization/depreciation of an asset) and data visualization of the company's current statements using MatPlotLib.
